\title{Cluster Clonal IDs Based on CDR3 Similarity}
\usage{
cluster_duplicates_by_cdr3(
  clonal.df,
  clonal_id,
  cdr3_lengths,
  dist_method,
  h_height
)
}
\arguments{
\item{clonal.df}{A simplified data frame with at least CDR3, \code{cell_id}, and gene columns.}

\item{clonal_id}{A character vector of V-J-CDR3L combinations.}

\item{cdr3_lengths}{A numeric vector of CDR3 lengths, same length as \code{clonal_id}.}

\item{h_height}{The height threshold (between 0 and 1) for clustering.}
}
\value{
A data frame with a \code{clonality} column assigning clone IDs.
}
\description{
Clusters sequences with identical V-J-CDR3L identifiers into subclones based on CDR3 sequence similarity.
Uses hierarchical clustering with a specified height threshold. Clone groups are sorted by decreasing size.
