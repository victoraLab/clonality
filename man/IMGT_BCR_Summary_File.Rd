\title{IMGT BCR Summary File}
\format{
A data frame with N rows and 34 columns:
\describe{
\item{Sequence_ID}{Unique identifier for the sequence assigned by IMGT.}
\item{VDOMAIN_Functionality}{Functionality status of the V domain (e.g., productive, unproductive).}
\item{VGENE_and_allele}{Identified V gene and allele.}
\item{JGENE_and_allele}{Identified J gene and allele.}
\item{DNA_Junction}{Nucleotide sequence of the junction region.}
}

Columns not listed here include detailed scores, region insertions/deletions, trimming counts, comments, and
alternative identity metrics, all retained for reference and advanced filtering.

\source{
Generated from \verb{1_Summary.txt}, the output of IMGT HighV-QUEST, and processed via \code{data-raw/IMGT_BCR_Summary_File.R}.
}
\usage{
IMGT_BCR_Summary_File
}
\description{
A processed summary table of B cell receptor (BCR) sequences analyzed using the IMGT HighV-QUEST pipeline.
Each row represents a unique immunoglobulin sequence annotated with V(D)J gene usage, junction details, and
CDR/FR region lengths.
